Klarobelia subglobosa
Critically Endangered B2ab(i,iii); D
Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of
Klarobelia subglobosa is only known from the type locality in El Ávila National Park, in the surroundings of Caracas, were it occurs in semi-deciduous forest. This park faces a number of threats of which most immediate ones are forest fires and illegal settlements, not only around Caracas but also in the more isolated northern slope and eastern sector of El Ávila. The species is only known from the type collection. The population size is estimated to be less than 50 mature individuals (Chatrou and Pirie, 2005). Despite extensive explorations, reflected in Steyermark and Huber (1978) and Meier (1998), only a single specimen of this species has been collected so far. Therefore, based on criterion B (small area of occupancy, number of locations is one, and an inferred continuing decline in extent of occurrence and area, extent and/or quality of habitat) and criterion D (number of mature individuals < 50), this species was assessed as Critically Endangered (CR) B1ab(i,iii); D.

Monanthotaxis couvreurii
Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Cameroon
This forest liana species, recorded growing up to 20 m in length, is endemic to the Ottotomo Forest Reserve in the Central Region of Cameroon. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), both of 4 km2, are below the thresholds for a Critically Endangered category under criterion B. At its only known location, this species is threatened by agriculture and logging, and these threats are causing the extent and quality of suitable habitat to decline. There is limited population information available for this species, and so an assessment cannot be made under criteria A, C or D. Therefore, this species is assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion B, maintaining the provisional red list assessment by Hoekstra et al. (2016). Surveys are needed to confirm the species' current distribution, and its population status and trends.

Brazil (Espírito Santo)
Árvore de até 10 m, endêmica do Brasil (Flora do Brasil, 2018). Foi coletada em Floresta Ombrófila Densa Submontana associada à Mata Atlântica no estado do Espírito Santo, município de Santa Teresa. Apresenta distribuição muito restrita, EOO=55 km², uma situação de ameaça e ocorrência exclusiva em fitofisionomia severamente fragmentada. Estima-se que restem atualmente cerca de 15% da vegetação original da Mata Atlântica (SOS Mata Atlântica e INPE, 2018). Sabe-se que grande parte dos ecossistemas florestais capixabas se encontram fragmentados como resultado de atividades antrópicas realizadas no passado e atualmente, restando somente 12,6% de remanescentes florestais originais (SOS Mata Atlântica e INPE, 2018). Apesar de relativamente bem documentada desde sua descrição original e da ocorrência em unidades de conservação de proteção integral, sabe-se que vetores de stress incidem sobre a população de U. sancta-teresae situada dentro dos limites destas áreas (Mendes e Padovan, 2000). Assim, a espécie foi considerada como Criticamente em Perigo (CR) de extinção. Infere-se declínio contínuo em EOO, AOO e qualidade e extensão de habitat. Recomendam-se ações de pesquisa (distribuição, busca por novas localidades, censo, números e tendências populacionais) e conservação (Plano de Ação, garantia de efetividade das UCs) a fim de se garantir a perpetuação desta espécie no futuro.

Árvore de até 25 m, endêmica do Brasil (Flora do Brasil, 2018). Foi coletada em Floresta Estacional Semidecidual Submontana associada à Mata Atlântica no estado do Espírito Santo, município de Linhares. A espécie apresenta distribuição muito restrita, EOO=12 km², AOO=12 km² e ocorrência em uma situação de ameaça, e em fitofisionomia florestal severamente fragmentada. A exploração de florestas no Espírito Santo teve um caráter predatório, com o rápido esgotamento das reservas florestais nativas (Siqueira et al., 2004). Atualmente, restam cerca de 12,6% da Mata Atlântica capixaba original (SOS Mata Atlântica e INPE, 2018), e Linhares possui 34% de sua área convertida em pastagens (Lapig 2018). Adicionalmente, o estado se projeta como um dos maiores produtores globais de celulose, com o estabelecimento, incentivado por programas de fomento do governo federal, de extensos cultivos de Eucalyptus e Pinus (Siqueira et al., 2004). A espécie poderia ser considerada como Dados Insuficientes (DD), porém, considerando-se sua descrição recente, o cenário de degradação da Mata Atlântica capixaba e a ausência de habitat potencial fora dos locais onde foi tradicionalmente coletada, optou por conduzir avaliação de risco de extinção. Apesar da presença confirmada em área protegida, esta é de caráter privado e portanto, não vitalício.

Assim, considera-se O. unibracteata Criticamente em Perigo (CR) de extinção, pela sua distribuição restrita. Infere-se declínio contínuo em EOO, AOO, qualidade e extensão de habitat e, possivelmente, no número de situações de ameaça. Recomendam-se ações de pesquisa (distribuição, números e tendências populacionais, busca por subpopulações em áreas adjacentes) e conservação (Plano de Ação, busca por subpopulações dentro de unidade de conservação) a fim de se evitar a completa extinção de O. unibracteata da natureza.

Neo-uvaria viridifolia
Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Philippines
Neo-uvaria viridifolia  is an endemic tree species in the Philippines with occurrences only recorded in the narrow and wooded creek ravine in Mt. Urdaneta, Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte at about 1,000 meter above sea level. It has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) of 4 km2 accounting to its sole identified location. Population size is currently not known due to lack of surveys and documentation, but a continuous decline is suspected due to habitat threatening effects of commodity-driven deforestation, and  urbanization. Due to its restricted occurrence, very small EOO and AOO values, and the current threats to the population and habitat quality, the species is globally assessed as Critically Endangered (CR). Aside from the conservation in protected areas where it naturally occurs, more active measures should be implemented (e.g. artificial propagation, reintroduction to various arboreta in the country) to assure future survival.

Popowia lanceolata
Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Philippines
Popowia lanceolata is an endemic species in the Philippines which was only recorded in Dinagat Islands in Surigao del Norte during the 1919’s plant survey by Ramos and Pascasio. With the best available data, both its extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated at 4 km2 which account for one location. Based on the data from the Global Forest Watch, tree cover loss was documented and caused by commodity-driven deforestation. Hence, a decline in population is suspected. Given the rarity and lack of specific conservation action plan for the species, it is assessed as Critically Endangered. Protection of site is recommended since it is not within a declared protected area nor a designated Key Biodiversity Area. Immediate research and inventory are needed to account for population size and verify genuine decline. Introduction to botanic gardens as ex situ collections is suggested as well to ensure continuous survival.

Polyceratocarpus askhambryan-iringae is endemic to the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, unique to the Udzungwa bloc. It is known from Mwanihana Forest in the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Ndundulu Forest in the Kilombero Nature Reserve, and the Uzungwa Scarp Forest Reserve. In a study of this species by Marshell et al. (2016), it was proposed that this species is estimated to have three to four locations. The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at 24–300 km2 and the extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 780–1,410 km2. The population size of this species is unknown but estimated to be in continual decline and reducing in number of mature individuals. This species faces threats of ongoing logging by local communities and habitat disturbance by African elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations, as well as increasing human developments. Due to these ongoing threats, declining population and habitat degradation, as well as restricted distribution, this species is assessed as Endangered.

Xylopia densiflora
Endangered B2ab(iii)
Peru
Because the only data source that was available for this species was herbarium data, only criterion B could be used for the assessment. The extent of occurrence (EOO) was too large to be considered threatened (246,208 km2) but area of occupancy (AOO) (16 km2) would classify it as threatened. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was then determined by overlaying the distribution map with a map of protected areas. For this assessment, it was assumed that forest cover loss is regulated differently outside and across different protected areas and occurrences within different protected areas and thus every occurrence point within a particular protected area is considered as one location. For occurrence points that are not situated in a protected area, a 10 km grid was used to separate different locations. By using this method, it was determined that this species has four locations, which makes it Endangered. However, it must be noted that because herbarium data were used, the AOO and number of locations are a conservative estimate.

This species occurs in the three Guianas and Ecuador. The extent of occurrence (EOO) was large enough to not be considered threatened (164,980 km2) but the area of occupancy (AOO) of 20 km2 is small and could potentially qualify the species as threatened. The AOO is likely to be underestimated because it depends on a 2x2 km grid that is overlaid over the occurrence points, which are a qualitative and not a quantitative data source. Although the AOO may be larger with greater collection effort it is unlikely to exceed 500 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was then determined by overlaying the distribution map with a map of protected areas. By using this method, it was determined that this species has five locations, which makes it Endangered.

Mischogyne gabonensis
Endangered B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)
Cameroon; Equatorial Guinea (Bioko); Gabon
A preliminary assessment of this species has been proposed in Gosline et al.(2019) as EN B2ab(ii). We propose here an update of the rationale and the criteria used to assess this species.
Mischogyne gabonensis is a tree up to 25 m tall, known from lowland evergreen terra firme rainforest, up to 450 m above sea level. The species is known from five collections, of which one was made in Gabon by Le Testu near Mayumba (Nyanga Province) in 1914. Three collections were made in Cameroon: one in the vicinity of the Mount Cameroon National Park (Sout-west Province) by Kenfack in 2001, one at the edge but within the Mount Cameroon National Park by Couvreur in 2016, and one at Nkoolong, 30 km East of Campo (South province) by Satabié. One collection was made by Luke in 2007in Equatorial Guinea, on the island of Bioko, in the Reserva Científica de la Caldera de Luba. These five collections represent five occurrences and four subpopulations. Given that the forest coverage is still significant in these areas, we consider that none of the occurrences is extirpated. Based on a 2 km x 2 km cell size, the AOO of this species is estimated as 20 km2, below the upper threshold for “Endangered” status under Criterion B2. The EOO is calculated as 58,245 km², above the upper threshold for “Vulnerable” status under Criterion B1. Two occurrences are located in a protected area in both Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. However, the development of a new road in the Reserva Científica de la Caldera de Luba in Equatorial Guinea (Bioko) is currently increasing development pressure in the area (Cronin et al. 2015) and the occurrence could be subject to a decline of the quality of its habitat. The occurrence in the Mount Cameroun National Park is currently threatened by small-scale agriculture that induces a decline in the extent and the quality of the habitat of the species. The occurrence in the vicinity of the Mount Cameroon National Park is situated at 800 m of an industrial oil palm plantation, which disconnects its habitat to the rest of the forest, and is subject to small-scale agriculture and wood harvesting that induce a decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. We infer that these threats could, in the future, lead to the extirpation of this occurrence. The occurrence made near Nkoolong in Cameroun is located in-between a logging concession and a rubber tree plantation, and is situated within a radius of 10 km from a main mineral deposit (Milesi et al. 2006) for which industrial mining will likely take place in the near future. All these three industrial activities are already inducing or will induce a decline of the extent and quality of the habitat of the species. The exact location of the Gabonese occurrence is unknown and it is not clear that it still exists due to the development of the city of Mayumba. A project of development of the region around Mayumba is planned (project Grande Mayumba) where logging, agro-industries and new infrastructures will take place. We infer that these activities will induce a decline in the extent and quality of the habitat of the species and could result in the extirpation of the occurrence. As a consequence, the five occurrences represent five locations (sensu IUCN 2019) with regards to the most important threats (small-scale agriculture, large-scale logging, road, urbanization and mining). We infer a past, present and future decline in the extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, extent and quality of the habitat, number of locations and subpopulations and number of mature individuals of this species. Mischogyne gabonensis is thus assessed EN B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v).

Annona parviflora
Endangered B1ab(iii)
Brazil
The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 1,538 km2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) is 16 km2. Both are small and could potentially qualify the species as threatened (can be classified as Endangered). However, the AOO is likely to be underestimated because it depends on a 2x2 km grid that is overlaid over the occurrence points, which are a qualitative and not a quantitative data source. It is not thought that the AOO exceeds 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was then determined by overlaying the distribution map with a map of protected areas. By using this method, it was determined that this species has four locations, which means this species is assessed as Endangered.

Annona bicolor
Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Dominican Republic
This small tree or shrub is endemic to the Dominican Republic. The geographic range is restricted, and the extent of occurrence measures 1,341 km2 and the area of occupancy is 20 km2. However, the area of occupancy is based on herbarium data, and is likely to be an underestimate of the true area of occupancy, although it is not thought to exceed 500 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. Based on known collections of this species, we estimate that there are five locations. Based on the available information the species is listed as Endangered. However, more information on the full extent of this species and the threats that impact it is desired.

Annona punicifolia
Endangered B2ab(iii)
Colombia; Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of
Because the only data source that was available for this species was herbarium data, only criterion B could be used for the assessment. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is too large to classify as threatened (26,675 km2) but the area of occupancy (AOO) is 20 km2 which would classify as threatened. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. It was determined that this species has five locations, which makes it Endangered. However, it must be noted that because herbarium data were used, the AOO and number of locations are a conservative estimate.

Pseuduvaria multiovulata
Endangered B2ab(iii)
Myanmar (Myanmar (mainland)); Thailand
This species occurs in southern Myanmar (Burma) and north east Thailand. The collections of this species from Myanmar are old (1901 and 1926), with the current status of the species in the region unknown due to insufficient collecting. Although once known from several localities in Thailand, recent collections (2001) are only known from one site in Prachuap, with collections from other localities dating from 1924–1929. This infers that this species has no more than five locations as the area faces threats of habitat loss and degradation. The area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is estimated at 20 km2, and the extent of occurrence (EOO) of this species is estimated at 100,099 km2. Population size and trend is also unknown, but not clearly so from lack of data or surveying bias. This species does occur within more than one protected area, but given its restricted range and threats, is assessed as Endangered.

Goniothalamus palawanensis
Endangered B1ab(i,ii,iii)+2ab(i,ii,iii)
Philippines
Goniothalamus palawanensis is an endemic tree species to the Philippines which can only be found on the island of Palawan particularly in dipterocarp and limestone forest at low altitudes 50–120 m. It has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 264.881 km² and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 12 km² accounting for its two identified locations based on all currently available species' information. Due to its small AOO and few locations, the species is assessed as Endangered. Although it is occurring in declared protected areas, conservation of its population is not guaranteed due to continuous land use change and degradation of natural habitat brought by urbanisation and commodity-driven deforestation. A tree cover loss of about 163,000 hectares was reported based on data from 2000 to 2020. A decline in its EOO, AOO and extent/quality of habitat is, thus, inferred. A species-specific conservation program should put be in place. In addition, its introduction to botanic gardens for ex situ conservation is suggested.

Monoon barnesii
Endangered B2ab(i,ii,iii)
Philippines
Monoon barnesii  is an endemic tree species in the Philippines which can be found in mixed dipterocarp forest along slopes in Bataan, Mindoro, Ilocos Sur, and Cagayan. It thrives in forest at low elevation, 100 to 300 m above sea level. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 51,238.929 km² and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 24 km² accounting for its four identified locations that are continuously threatened by shifting agriculture, commodity-driven deforestation, urbanisation and losses from forest plantations and natural forest harvesting. Its population size is currently not known due to lack of survey and documentation, but a continuous decline is expected due to habitat threatening effects of shifting agriculture, commodity-driven deforestation, urbanisation and losses from forest plantations and natural forest harvesting. Though having a relatively large distribution, the species is still assessed globally as Endangered with its limited number of locations, a very small AOO value based from limited known occurrences, and the current threats that are detrimental to its population and habitat quality and extent. Being assessed as such, immediate and active conservation measures must be considered in order to prevent the species from being pushed into further endangerment in the future.

Monoon mindanaense is an endemic tree species to the Philippines which can be found in Palawan, Oriental Mindoro, Lanao del Norte, and Davao del Sur. It thrives in lowland mixed dipterocarp and limestone forest at low and medium elevation ranging from 200 to 1,200 m. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 173607.592 km² and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 20 km² accounting for its four identified locations. Its population size is currently not known due to lack of surveys and documentations made, but a continuous decline is expected due to habitat threatening effects of shifting agriculture, commodity-driven deforestation, urbanisation and losses from forest plantations and natural forest harvesting. Though having a relatively large distribution, the species is still assessed globally as Endangered with its limited number of locations, a very small AOO value based on limited known occurrences, and the current threats that are detrimental to its population and habitat quality and extent. Being assessed as such, immediate and active conservation measures must be considered in order to prevent the species from being pushed into further endangerment in the future.

Orophea leytensis
Endangered B1ab(i,ii,iii)+2ab(i,ii,iii)
Philippines
Orophea leytensis is an endemic tree species to the Philippines recorded in damp forests of Northern Samar, Samar and Leyte at low elevations. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1559.309 km² and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 16 km² accounting for its three identified locations. Due to its small EOO and AOO and few number of locations, the species is assessed as Endangered. Although it is occurring in a declared protected area, conservation of its population is not guaranteed due to continuous land use change and degradation of natural habitat brought by urbanisation, unsustainable shifting agriculture, commodity-driven deforestation, and logging operations. A tree cover loss of about 109,660 hectares was reported based on data from 2000 to 2019. A decline in its EOO, AOO and extent/quality of habitat is, thus, inferred. A species-specific conservation program should be put in place. In addition, its introduction to botanic gardens for ex situ conservation is suggested.

Mischogyne congensis
Endangered B2ab(iii)
Congo, The Democratic Republic of the
This small tree is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is currently known from only four locations on the Congo, Aruwimi, Lindi, and Tshuapa rivers. The Meise herbarium has 5,339 Annonaceae specimens from the DRC, many collected near the biological research station at Yangambi. The existence of only six specimens indicates that the species is rare. The area around Yangambi on the Congo is subject to continuing urbanisation as seen in satellite images. All the locations appear to be impacted by shifting cultivation. Threats from deforestation along the rivers appear to be substantial. It is therefore assessed here as Endangered.

Monodora zenkeri
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Cameroon
This species is a lianescent tree or sarmentose shrub, endemic to Cameroon, where it occurs in the South, East, and Central Regions. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 46,339 km2 exceeds the threshold values for a threatened category under criterion B1. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of 40 km2 falls below the threshold for an Endangered category under criterion B2. This AOO is likely to be an underestimate due to the difficulty in obtaining comprehensive survey information, however, the true value is suspected to not exceed the Vulnerable threshold for criterion B2 of 2,000 km2. The species faces major threats posed by logging, agricultural encroachment, and urban expansion. Given these threats, the species is thought to occur at nine locations and is experiencing a decline in the extent and quality of suitable habitat. There is limited population information available for this range-restricted species, and so an assessment cannot be made under criterion A, C, or D. Therefore, the species is assessed as Vulnerable B2ab(iii).

Uvariopsis zenkeri
Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)
Cameroon
Uvariopsis zenkeri is a small tree up to 7 m high and 11 cm DBH, endemic to Cameroon, known from primary and old secondary terra firme rainforests, up to 700 m above sea level. Several herbarium specimens previously identified as U. zenkeri, collected in Rio Muni (Equatorial Guinea), Gabon, Central African Republic, and Democratic Republic of the Congo, have recently been reidentified as U. congensis, U. solheidii or U. sp. The species is thus known from 16 herbarium collections and one human observation (plot data by Tchouto). Eleven collections and one human observation were made in the South province, including eight collections made at Bipinde by Zenker (including the specimen type in 1896) and by Annet at the beginning of the 20th century. Four collections were made in the South-west province by Ekema (944), Thomas (3455 and 7372), and Couvreur (1027). One collection (Osborne 200) was made in the Ebo Forest Reserve in the Littoral province. Considering the forest coverage, which is still important in the areas of collection, and even if some collections are old, we consider the occurrences as not extirpated. The 16 herbarium collections and one human observation represent thus eleven occurrences. Based on a 2 km x 2 km cell size, the AOO of this species is estimated as 44 km2, below the upper threshold for “Endangered” status under Criterion B2. The EOO is calculated as 39,194 km², above the upper threshold for “Vulnerable” status under Criterion B1. Six occurrences are located in protected areas: Thomas 7372 in the Takamanda Forest Reserve, Thomas 3455 in the Mount Cameroon National Park, Osborne 200 in the Ebo Forest Reserve, and Couvreur 707, Tchouto 2846 and the human observation in the Campo Ma’an National Park. Nevertheless, the occurrence Thomas 3455, located in the lowland forest of the park, is threatened by shifting agriculture, along with the occurrence Couvreur 1027 made just outside the National Park. These two occurrences represent two locations. Likewise, the collection Tchouto 2846 and the human observation, located at the North edge of the Campo Ma’an National Park, could be threatened by shifting agriculture, and the occurrence Thomas 7372 situated in the Takamanda Forest Reserve is threatened by the expansion of shifting agriculture, wood harvesting and logging in the area (Comiskey et al. 2003) that induce a decline in the extent and quality of the habitat of the species. They represent one location each. The two occurrences from Bipindi are also threatened by shifting agriculture and represent one location. The occurrence Ekema 944 is threatened by logging, which induces a degradation of the quality of the species habitat, and thus represents one location. Last, the occurrence Tchouto 3252, is surrounded by a logging concession that could induce a degradation of the quality of the habitat of the species, and is located on a main mineral deposit (Milesi et al. 2006) which could be exploited in the near future, and that will lead to an extirpation of this location. The others occurrences located in protected areas do not appear to be threatened. Based on the main threat (shifting agriculture), the eleven occurrences represent nine locations (sensu IUCN 2019). Due to the extirpation of the occurrence Tchouto 3252, we infer a continuing decline in the extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, extent and quality of the habitat, number of locations and number of mature individuals of this species. Uvariopsis zenkeri is thus assessed as VU B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v).

Tetrameranthus umbellatus
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Brazil (Amazonas); Peru
This tree species occurs in Brazil and Peru. Because the only data source that was available for this species was herbarium data, only criterion B could be used for the assessment. The extent of occurrence (EOO), 415,237 km2, did not classify as threatened but the area of occupancy (AOO), 24 km2, fell into the Endangered category. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was then determined by overlaying the distribution map with a map of protected areas. For this assessment, it was assumed that forest cover loss is regulated differently outside and across different protected areas and occurrences within different protected areas and thus every occurrence point within a particular protected area is considered as one location. For occurrence points that are not situated in a protected area, a 10 km grid was used to separate different locations. By using this method, it was determined that this species has six locations, which makes it Vulnerable. However, it must be noted that because herbarium data were used, the AOO and number of locations are a conservative estimate.

Alphonsea havilandii
Vulnerable A2c
Malaysia (Sabah, Sarawak)
Alphonsea havilandii is a small tree, endemic to Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak). The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are 12 km2 and 50,498.2 km2, respectively. Due to habitat loss (Sabah), it is suspected that the species experienced at least 30% population declined in about two generations (based on reduction analysis in GeoCAT). The species remains in at least two sites, one in a protected area and the other on the boundary of a protected area. Therefore, continuing decline in population or habitat cannot be confirmed. This species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Árvore de até 9 m, endêmica do Brasil (Flora do Brasil, 2018). Popularmente conhecida por Pindaíba, foi coletada em Floresta Ombrófila Densa de tabuleiro associada à Mata Atlântica no estado da Bahia. Apresenta distribuição restrita, EOO=16.343 km², sete situações de ameaça e ocorrência em fitofisionomia florestal severamente fragmentada. Estima-se que restem atualmente cerca de 15% da vegetação original da Mata Atlântica (SOS Mata Atlântica e INPE, 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2009). Sabe-se que grande parte dos ecossistemas florestais da Bahia encontram-se fragmentadas como resultado de atividades antrópicas realizadas no passado e atualmente, restando 12% de remanescentes florestais originais (SOS Mata Atlântica e INPE, 2018). Desmatamento, corte madeireiro e implementação de atividades agrossilvipecuárias em larga escala (Paciencia e Prado, 2005), principalmente plantações de Eucalyptus sp.

Adicionalmente, municípios de ocorrência perderam entre 75%-82% de sua cobertura florestal original (SOS Mata Atlântica e INPE, 2018). Apesar da ocorrência em unidade de conservação de proteção integral, foi considerada como Vulnerável (VU) de extinção. Infere-se declínio contínuo em EOO e extensão e qualidade de habitat. Recomendam-se ações de pesquisa (distribuição, busca por novas localidades, censo, números e tendências populacionais) e conservação (Plano de Ação) a fim de se garantir a perpetuação desta espécie no futuro.

Polyalthia spathulata
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatera)
This species is a tree endemic to Indonesia, where it occurs in lowland rain forests on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo (where it is apparently restricted to Balikpapan in East Kalimantan). It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 535,889 km2 which far exceeds thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B1. It has an area of occupancy (AOO) of only 32 km2 though this is likely to be an underestimate due to the wide distribution of this species. However, assuming it is restricted to the Balikpapan area of Borneo and given the extent of habitat loss within the EOO, it is unlikely to have an AOO that exceeds the 2,000 km2 threshold needed for a threatened category under criterion B2. The population size of this species is unknown though it is not very well collected and therefore may be rare. Habitat loss has been extensive at several localities from which this species has been recorded, with conversion of primary forests to plantations being the primary threat. These plantations generally cover vast areas of land and result in almost complete loss of original vegetation. Based on the known collections, there are approximately seven to eight locations. Taking a precautionary approach, this species is therefore assessed as Vulnerable B2ab(iii). Further research into the current distribution and population size of this species is needed to better understand its conservation status.

Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of
This species is endemic to Venezuela. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 62,531 km2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) is 40 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The species is found in 10 locations, which makes it Vulnerable. However, it must be noted that because herbarium data were used, the AOO and number of locations are a conservative estimate.

Uvaria buchholzii
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Cameroon; Congo, The Democratic Republic of the; Gabon
This shrub or tree species occurs in Cameroon, DRC, and Gabon. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 353,746 km2 exceeds the threshold for a threatened category under criterion B1. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of 24 km2 is below the threshold value for the Endangered category under criterion B2. This AOO, based on herbarium specimens, is likely to be an underestimate due to the difficulty in compiling comprehensive survey information. However, the species is reported to be relatively rare, and the true AOO is suspected not to exceed the Vulnerable threshold for criterion B2 of 2,000 km2. The main threats to this species are forest clearance for agriculture, plantations, logging, and mining activities, and as a result a continuing decline in the extent and quality of suitable habitat available is inferred. There is limited population information available for this species, and so an assessment cannot be made under criteria A, C or D. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable B2ab(iii).

Bolivia, Plurinational States of
As this evaluation is based on herbarium data, only criterion B could be used for the assessment. The extent of occurrence (EOO) estimated using ConR (Dauby 2018) was too large to be classified as threatened (302,428 km2). The area of occupancy (AOO) was estimated to be 64 km2. This species may be undercollected but the AOO is unlikely to exceed 2,000 km2. It is estimated that there are 6–10 locations. Most of the locations are in the Santa Cruz department and the plains here have been subject to extensive habitat loss. The locations here are highly threatened or may be lost. The locations alongside motorways are also at risk of further habitat loss. Considering the AOO, number of locations and threats to the habitat, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Gabon
Sirdavidia solannona is found in Gabon and Cameroon. The species is only known from five herbarium specimens, collected at three sites, but recent collections and observations are missing in Cameroon. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 43,595 km², exceeding the threshold of the Vulnerable category under criterion B1. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is very restricted, only 16 km², which qualifies for Vulnerable category under D2. It is found in one protected area (Monts de Cristal National Park, Gabon) and does not appear to be threatened by major threats at other localities. However, it is plausible that habitat loss due to future human activities (forest clearance for road development/small-scale agriculture), would lead this restricted-range species to higher extinction risk. Therefore the species is listed as Vulnerable (D2).

Trigynaea lagaropoda
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Ecuador; Peru
This small tree species occurs in Peru and Ecuador. While the extent of occurrence (EOO) did not classify for being threatened (251,704 km2), the area of occupancy (AOO) is small (44 km2) and could potentially qualify the species as threatened. Although the AOO is likely to be underestimated, it is not thought that the AOO exceeds 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was then determined by overlaying the distribution map with a map of protected areas. By using this method, it was determined that this species has 10 locations, which means this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Cameroon; Congo, The Democratic Republic of the; Gabon
Although moderately widespread, it is both patchy and rare: despite intensive inventories at Korup it has not been recorded there. There is no data on threats (or its continued existence) at sites in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the prospects of continued forest quality at Takamanda have not been enhanced by construction of a new road there; the site at Mt Kupe, above Kupe village, is within 100 m of cultivated land and has been earmarked for expansion. However, the small plot containing this Uvariopsis has been rented for conservation purposes by the Kew team from the farmer and monitored since 1995 and has seen no deterioration since that time. With eight locations, an area of occupancy is 32 km² and continuing decline due to the threat of agricultural expansion, the previous assessments in Cheek et al. (2004: 144) and Onana and Cheek (2011: 82) as Endangered are downgraded here to Vulnerable. This is because of the discovery of additional records in Gabon.

Xylopia africana
Vulnerable A2c
Cameroon; Equatorial Guinea (Bioko); Nigeria; Sao Tome and Principe
Of all the forests that we have surveyed, Xylopia africana has been found in greatest density at the Bali-Ngemba Forest Reserve in North West Province, Cameroon. This, now the largest remnant of the forest that cloaked the Bamenda Highlands at the 1,300-1,900 m range, is only 100 ha in extent and shrinking fast due to illegal clearance for farming. Presumably this species was once common throughout the Bamileke Plateau and Bamenda Highlands where it is now all but extinct. While there are no figures for rates of forest loss in the Bamenda Highlands as a whole, in one area which has been studied, the Kilum-Ijim area, forest loss of 25% over 8 years in the 1980s-1990s has been recorded (Moat in Cheek et al. 2000) and in another 50% in 15 years (Baena in Cheek et al. 2010). Past and ongoing forest loss in the Bamenda Highlands is therefore the main basis for the threat to Xylopia africana. On Mt Cameroon it appears rare, being found only twice in the surveys of 1992-1994. Elsewhere in the mountains of the Cameroon line it is also known from the extension into Nigeria: the Obudu Plateau where it is also threatened due to forest clearance, if indeed, it is still extant there. It is also known from São Tomé and Bioko in the Gulf of Guinea. Bali Ngemba, Mt Kupe and the Bakossi Mts. probably now support the largest single subpopulations of Xylopia africana. The original assessment of Vulnerable from Cheek et al. (2004 is maintained here). This assessment is based on an inferred population reduction of at least 30% in the past three generations (300 years).

Kenya; Tanzania, United Republic of
Xylopia arenaria is an endemic small tree from the lowland forest and woodland of coastal Kenya and Tanzania. This species has a restricted extent of occurrence (EOO), at only 14,516 km². Its area of occupancy (AOO) is also small, estimated at only 80 km², and it is inferred to be in continuing decline. The species was reported to be locally common in some localities, but the population is thought to be decreasing. Although the species is found in eight protected areas, it is threatened by forest and woodland clearance for charcoal production and small-scale agriculture. Based on the best data we have, the species is considered to occur in eight threat-defined locations. Therefore the species is listed as Vulnerable. However, if the decline in the extent and quality of its habitat continues it is likely that Xylopia arenaria will be up-listed to the Endangered category.

Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv)
Madagascar
Xylopia beananensis is a tree growing in humid and subhumid forests in north western, eastern and central Madagascar. The calculated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 124,929 km², exceeding the threshold for a threatened category, and the minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is 68 km², which falls within the threshold for Endangered. It exists at ten locations with respect to the primary threat of habitat destruction by fire, falling within the threshold for Vulnerable. This species occurs within Ambohijanahary, Anjanaharibe Sud, Galoko Kalobinono, Makira, Marojejy and Tsaratanana protected areas. Continuing decline is projected in the three subpopulations that occur outside of protected area due to habitat destruction (logging, agricultural practices, fire and mining). Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Xylopia gilbertii
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Cameroon; Central African Republic; Congo, The Democratic Republic of the; Gabon
Xylopia gilbertii is tree growing up to 40 m in height. It is distributed from South-East Cameroon and North of Gabon, to western Central African Republic and North of Democratic Republic of Congo. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is relatively large (455,041 km²), but its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at only 64 km². This very low AOO is thought to be partly a result of the species having been under-collected. Thus it is likely that the species has a larger AOO but it would still fall below the threshold of the threatened category under criterion B. This tree is mainly threatened by habitat degradation/loss due to logging activities and forest clearance for small-scale agriculture and it is estimated to only occur in seven locations. It is only found in two protected areas. Therefore the species is listed as Vulnerable.

Xylopia lemurica
Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)
Madagascar
Xylopia lemurica grows in Fianarantsoa and Toamasina provinces of Madagascar. It has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 21,546 km2 (exceeding the upper limit for Vulnerable status), an area of occupancy (AOO) of 76 km2 (within the limits for Endangered status under criterion B2), and it is present in eight locations. Four subpopulations are found in Protected Areas. Three subpopulations occur outside of protected area and experience continuing decline because of mining exploitation, slash and burn agriculture and logging. Therefore, this species is currently assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B2.

Xylopia mildbraedii
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Cameroon; Gabon
Xylopia mildbraedii is a tree, growing up to 9 m tall, distributed in the western part of Central Africa. It is only found in primary and old secondary lowland forests. The major threat to this tree, is habitat degradation and habitat loss due to logging and the species is estimated to occur in no more seven locations. Although its extent of occurrence (EOO) is not small (200,080 km²), its area of occupancy (AOO) is restricted, being estimated at only 72 km². Therefore, the species is assessed as being Vulnerable.

Xylopia monticola
Vulnerable B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Cameroon; Nigeria
Xylopia monticola is endemic to the easternmost part of Nigeria and adjoining Cameroon. The overall extent of occurrence (EOO) is small (18,590 km²), meeting the Vulnerable category threshold and the minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is 36 km². It is estimated that there are six to nine locations. The species could be locally threatened by gallery forests removal, as it was reported around Gembu and other small cities on Mambilla Plateau (Chapman and Chapman 2001). There are also some threats in the Gashaka-Gumti National Park (Nigeria) from illegal logging, agriculture and fire (Malik et al. 2016). Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Xylopia nilotica
Vulnerable B2ab(iii,iv)
South Sudan; Sudan; Uganda
Xylopia nilotica is a recently described tree, distributed from South of Sudan to Uganda. It is only represented by eight herbarium specimens and recent observations of this species are missing. The species appears to be threatened by habitat loss and habitat degradation, but the extent of these threats are not well documented, especially across South Sudan and Sudan. Its overall extent of occurrence (EOO) is not small (246,813 km²), but its very low area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at only 32 km². It is thought that the AOO is partly a result of the species having been under-collected by botanists, but the species is genuinely uncommon, and the AOO is not thought to exceed 2000 km2. Based on the current evidence, the AOO less than 2,000 km2, fewer than 10 locations, and the majority of locations with continuing decline in extent and quality of habitat, (and some of the locations may already have been lost), this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Xylopia orestera
Vulnerable B1ab(i,ii)+2ab(i,ii)
Malaysia (Sarawak)
This taxon is a small tree species endemic to Sarawak, Malaysia. The size of the species population is unknown. The species is recorded from three localities including one Totally Protected Area (i.e. Bukit Sengkajang in Batang Ai National Park). The species is most likely under-collected particularly from similar habitat at the nearby Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary which is also one of the largest Totally Protected Areas in Sarawak. Across Sarawak there has been 23% decline forest cover since the 1970s (Gaveau et al. 2014). It is suspected that the species has experienced population decline due to habitat loss when the habitats occur outside the Totally Protected Area system. Although based on the area of occupancy (AOO) value of the species it qualifies for the Endangered category, due to the underestimation in the AOO calculations from herbarium specimens, the species is globally assessed as Vulnerable.

Xylopia peruviana
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Bolivia, Plurinational States of; Peru
This species occurs in Peru and Bolivia. While the extent of occurrence (EOO) did not classify for being threatened (606,599 km2), the area of occupancy (AOO) is small (24 km2) and could potentially qualify the species as threatened. The AOO is likely to be underestimated, however, it is not thought that the AOO exceeds 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was determined to be 6, which means this species is assessed as Vulnerable.
