Ephedranthus columbianus
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Colombia
This species is endemic to Colombia. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 27,837 km2 and the area of occupancy (AOO) is 24 km2. Although the AOO is likely to be an underestimate, it is not thought to exceed 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The species is found in six locations. It is here assessed as Vulnerable.

Fenerivia angustielliptica
Vulnerable B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)+2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)
Madagascar
Fenerivia angustielliptica is endemic to Madagascar. It occurs in Analanjirofo, Atsinanana and Atsimo-Atsinanana regions from 5 to 150 m elevation. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 16,652 km² and the area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 20 km2 with six threat locations. There are six subpopulations detected for the species and the most recent collection was made in 2002 from Mahabo forest (Atsimo-Atsinanana region). Even the species is preserved in Agnalazaha and Masoala protected areas, its habitat is continually threatened by massive deforestation due to intensive shifting agriculture, logging, grazing and mining activities which affected much the survival of the species. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable (VU).

Fenerivia capuronii
Vulnerable B1ab(i,ii,iii,v)+2ab(i,ii,iii,v)
Madagascar
Fenerivia capuronii is an endemic tree growing in lowland forest in Anosy region (former povince of Toliara), eastern Madagascar. It has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 4,571 km² and an area of occupancy (AOO) of 76 km2. There are six locations with respect to the main threat, shifting agriculture. Even though it is observed in protected areas of Andohahela and Tsitongambarika, continuing declines are projected in its habitat quality and in the number of mature individuals, as a result of ongoing threats both inside and outside protected areas from massive deforestation due to expansion of shifting agriculture, fire, mining and logging. Fenerivia capuronii is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B.

Fenerivia chapelieri
Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)
Madagascar
Fenerivia chapelieri is endemic to Madagascar. It occurs in Alaotra - Mangoro, Analanjirofo, Anosy and Atsimo - Atsinanana regions from 5 to 975 m elevation. The extent of occurrence (EOO) and the area of occupancy (AOO) are estimated to be 51,444 km2 and 40 km2 respectively, in eight threat locations. Even though the species is recorded in two preserved important sites, its habitat is continually in decline due to massive deforestation, shifting agriculture and logging. Based on the available information, Fenerivia chapelieri is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B.

Madagascar
Fenerivia humbertii is a tree endemic to Madagascar. It grows in evergreen humid and subhumid forest in many region as Alaotra Mangoro, Analanjirofo, Anosy, SAVA and Vatovavy - Fitovinany from 100 to 1,150 m elevation. The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 68 km2 with 10 threat locations. Even though, the species is recorded in protected areas, the habitat of the species is threatened by shifting agriculture and logging. Therefore, the species is assessed as Vulnerable (VU).

Fenerivia oligosperma
Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)
Madagascar
Fenerivia oligosperma is a tree growing in north and central eastern Madagascar, in Montagne d'Ambre, COMATSA Notd and in Alaotra Mangoro region. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 38,785 km², which exceeds the values needed for a threatened category and the minimum area of occupancy (AOO) is 36 km² (within the limits for Endangered status under the criterion B2). There is six locations with respect the primary threat of habitat destruction for slash and burn agriculture and it would qualify for Vulnerable. Continuing decline is projected in the two subpopulations that occur outside of protected area because of habitat destruction due to deforestation (slash and burn agriculture and logging) and artisanal mining.  Therefore, the species is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B2.

Fenerivia richardiana
Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii,v)
Madagascar
Fenerivia richardiana endemic tree from Madagascar occurs in subhumid and humid forests from 10 to 1,300 m elevation. The area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 72 km2 and it is recorded in seven locations. Although the AOO may be larger with greater collection effort it is unlikely to exceed the boundaries of a threatened category. The habitat is threatened by logging, mining and expansion of agricultural areas which affected continually the survival of the species although recorded in important sites and protected areas as Galoko, Lokobe and Tsaratanana. Fenerivia richardiana is therefore assessed as Vulnerable (VU).

Goniothalamus bracteosus
Vulnerable A2c; B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Malaysia (Sabah)
Goniothalamus bracteosus is a tree restricted to Kinabalu Park, Sabah. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 24 km2 and extent of occurrence is 260 km2. Due to land use changes, it is estimated that the species has experienced a decline in area of occupancy (AOO) of at least 40% and extent of occurrence (EOO) of 42% in the last three generations, and this is suspected to have resulted in a population decline of at least 40% in the same timeframe. The species remains stable in protected areas but outside of these sites there is habitat decline. The species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Goniothalamus crockerensis
Vulnerable D2
Malaysia (Sabah)
This treelet is endemic to Sabah in the Crocker Range Park in the west of the state. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are 16 km2 and 79.5 km2, respectively. Two of the localities are confined to the southern part of Crocker Range Park, a protected area. Here the population and habitat is considered stable as the Crocker Range Park is a protected area. One site of the species is on a slope next to the main road from Kota Kinabalu to Keningau. The future possible threats would be land use changes and landslides due to changes in road reserve as a result of road expansion. If these serious plausible threats were to occur the species could become Critically Endangered or Extinct within one generation. The species is assessed as Vulnerable.
