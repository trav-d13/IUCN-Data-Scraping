Goniothalamus stenopetalus
Vulnerable B1ab(i,ii,iii)+2ab(i,ii,iii)
Malaysia (Sabah)
Goniothalamus stenopetalus is found in at least two Totally Protected Areas (TPAs) in Sabah: Crocker Range Park and Kinabalu Park. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are 32 km2 and 1,139 km2 respectively. Due to land use change, an estimated past decline of 25% of AOO and 29% of EOO has resulted in a remaining distribution of 24 km2 and 813 km2 respectively (based on GeoCAT reduction analysis). The remaining subpopulations occur within protected areas. However, localities outside or at the border of the reserve are at risk of land use change and forest fire. Hence, it is assessed as Vulnerable.

This species occurs in northern South America. The species is represented by a small number of herbarium records giving a small area of occupancy (AOO) of 52 km2. However, this AOO is suspected to be an underestimate due to the low collection effort. However with the current records, the extent of occurrence (EOO) is measured as 1,793,733 km2, but due to the loss of localities in the Brazilian state of Rondónia, the EOO is suspected to have declined by 39%. The main threats to the species is land conversion to urban areas but primarily conversion to agriculture. There may also be some impact due to logging. As these threats are continuing it is suspected that over three generations, population decline will be at least 30%. The species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Hornschuchia myrtillus
Vulnerable B2ab(ii,iii)
Brazil (Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais)
Esta espécie é popularmente conhecida por Pindaíba-rasteira. Ocorre no domínio da Mata Atlântica em Floresta Estacional Semidecidual e Floresta Ombrófila, nos estados da Bahia e Minas Gerais. Com uma área de ocupação (AOO) de 72 km², está sujeita a dez situações de ameaça.

Perda de habitat como consequência do desmatamento, desenvolvimento urbano, mineração, agricultura e pecuária, são ameaças à espécie e representam a maior causa de redução na biodiversidade da Mata Atlântica. Estima-se que restem apenas entre 11,4% a 16% da vegetação original deste hotspot, e cerca de 42% da área florestal total é representada por fragmentos menores que 250 ha (Ribeiro et al., 2009).

Da mesma forma é possível detectar a degradação da vegetação pela mineração de granito e fosfato no município de Águia Branca e ao redor do município de Linhares (ES) que vem sendo ocupado por empreendimentos minerários (DNPM, SIGMINE, 2019). Essa região foi recentemente (2015) diretamente afetada pelo maior desastre ambiental causado por mineração, com o rompimento da barragem de Fundão no município de Mariana (MPF, 2017).

A área relativamente grande ocupada por categorias de uso do solo como pastagem, agricultura e solo descoberto, e a pequena área relativa ocupada por floresta em estágio avançado de regeneração revelam o alto grau de fragmentação da Mata Atlântica no Sul-Sudeste da Bahia (Landau, 2003). Grande parte das florestas úmidas do sul da Bahia estão fragmentadas como resultado da atividade humana realizadas no passado, tais como o corte madeireiro e implementação da agricultura (Paciencia e Prado, 2005).

Embora registrada em Unidade de Conservação de proteção integral, infere-se o declínio contínuo de AOO, extensão e qualidade do habitat. A espécie foi assim considerada Vulnerável (VU) à extinção, devendo ser incentivadas ações de pesquisa (distribuição e censo populacional) e conservação (in situ e ex situ, inclusão em Plano de Ação e Planos de Manejo) para garantir sua perpetuação na natureza.

Vulnerable B2ab(i,ii,iii)
Philippines
Huberantha flava is a small tree endemic to the Philippines. It occurs in the provinces of Isabela, Zambales, Rizal, Camarines, Surigao del Norte, Cotabato and Davao. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 432,483 km2 and the estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is at least 40 km2. There is an inferred population decline due to large scale forestry operations, shifting agriculture and urbanization, supported by estimated tree cover loss of 407,000 hectares within the species' range. Although the species is widely distributed in the country, it is assessed as Vulnerable due to its restricted AOO, in addition to inferred continuing declines in EOO, AOO and quality of habitat, caused by continuous tree cover loss.

Isolona lebrunii
Vulnerable B2ab(ii,iii)
Burundi; Congo, The Democratic Republic of the; Rwanda
Isolona lebrunii is a poorly known tree distributed in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Burundi. It is not well represented in herbaria and has not been recently collected. It is reported to grow in moist montane forests, from 1,650 to 2,150 m asl. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 179,960 km², far exceeding the threshold of the Vulnerable category under criterion B1. However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is restricted at 60 km², which qualifies for Endangered category under B2. The species could have been under-collected and have a slightly larger AOO but it would still fall below 2,000 km², the boundaries of any threatened category under criterion B. More than half of the taxon's range is affected by habitat loss due to the combination of several major threats: mining exploitation, forest clearance for subsistence agriculture and tree cutting for charcoal production. The 13 known subpopulations of the species corresponds to nine locations, making the condition "a" met, and we infer a continuing decline in the extent of its habitat and its AOO. In addition, the species is only known to occurs in one protected area in Rwanda (Nyungwe National Park). As a result, the species is assessed as being Vulnerable (B2ab(ii,iii)).

Isolona pilosa is a small tree distributed across the West of Central Africa (Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cabinda Enclave of Angola). It is only represented by 16 herbarium specimens and recent collections are missing (a single collection over the past 30 years). This implies the species is either uncommon or has become rare. In addition it might be under-collected in Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cabinda Enclave. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is large, estimated at 1,015,783 km², far exceeding the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion B1. However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is restricted, at only 52 km², which qualifies for Endangered category under B2, and the subpopulations are thought to be small. The main threats to the species are habitat degradation and loss due to logging (in Cameroon, Gabon and Congo) and habitat loss due to forest clearance for agriculture (mainly in Democratic Republic of Congo). The species is estimated to occur in nine locations, making the condition "a", met. Finally, it is only known from a single protected area (Odzala National Park in Congo). As a result, despite its large geographic distribution, the species is assessed as being Vulnerable (B2ab(iii)).

This tree species occurs in Ecuador and Peru. The extent of occurrence (EOO) was large enough to not be considered threatened (194,638 km2) but the area of occupancy (AOO) is small (32 km2) and could potentially qualify the species as threatened. Although the AOO is likely to be underestimated it is not thought that it exceeds 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was determined as 8. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Mezzettia umbellata
Vulnerable A2c
Brunei Darussalam; Indonesia (Kalimantan); Malaysia (Sarawak, Sabah)
It is suspected that forest loss values for this lowland forest tree species are likely to bear a linear relationship to population reductions and, making use of information for similar species and analysis of forest loss, calculations result in an estimated population reduction of 36.8%. Although not specifically noted as a timber species, other similar species are utilised, and it may be subject to logging. Additionally, the rates of forest loss in peat swamp forest (a known habitat for this species) are noted to be higher than general lowland forest loss. Its karangas habitat is also easily degraded by logging and burning activities. However, it does occur in some protected areas where forest losses, whilst often not eliminated, are inferred to be minimized. Although there is uncertainty and forest losses have not been uniform, it is suspected that the population reductions for this species could fall within the values for a threatened category under criterion A. In view of this, it is assessed as Vulnerable.

Monanthotaxis suffruticosa is a scarce species of dry coastal forest, thicket and woodland in southeast Tanzania and northeast Mozambique. Whislt it has an extent of occurrence (EOO) of over 95,000 km2, this species is known at present from only six locations and is considered highly likely to have an area of occupancy (AOO) of considerably less than 2,000 km2. It is threatened in parts of its range, particularly in the Mozambican subpopulations, by habitat loss due to an expanding human population and increasing exploitation of natural resources and removal of woody vegetation. Oil and gas exploration in this area are also likely to threaten this species, not least through further local human population increases, attracted by the employment opportunities. Whilst the Tanzanian populations are likely to be more secure, there are increasing concerns over the long-term future of the Selous Game Reserve and the species it supports. With fewer than 10 locations known and an ongoing decline in extent and quality of suitable habitat, this species is currently assessed as Vulnerable under criterion B2 - VU B2ab(iii).

Monocarpia euneura
Vulnerable A2c
Brunei Darussalam; Indonesia (Kalimantan); Malaysia (Sarawak)
The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 420,000 km2 for this tree exceeds the values needed for a threatened category under criterion B. However, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less certain since no comprehensive survey information is available. This tree is relatively little recorded and may possibly be rare and the AOO may fall within threatened values. Although there are certainly continuing declines in area, extent and quality of habitat it is suspected that this lowland tree species may still be found at more than 10 locations and, as some larger blocks of habitat remain, particularly in protected areas it may not qualify as severely fragmented. As a perennial tree in a relatively constant environment it is suspected not to be subject to extreme fluctuations, however, it could qualify as Near Threatened under criterion B. The continued presence of this lowland tree species in several former areas of collection is uncertain, particularly as it is a species of undisturbed lowland forests and these forests have undergone substantial losses and disturbance within its range. Although all estimates are uncertain, based on a relationship of lowland forest deforestation loss to population reductions, particularly as this tree is also likely to be utilised for timber, it is suspected that the reductions over a three-generation time frame will have been sufficient to be within a threatened category under criterion A. Using the calculated 44% reduction, it is assessed as Vulnerable. Surveys and research are needed to provide further information to enable a more accurate assessment of its current status, particularly as there are few recent records and the reduction was calculated from losses in the 0–500 m asl range and this species is found below 200 m for which specific loss information was not available.

Although the AOO is likely to be underestimated, it is not thought that the AOO exceeds 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was then determined by overlaying the distribution map with a map of protected areas. This species was found in eight threat-based locations. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.

Oxandra maya
Vulnerable B1ab(iii)
Belize; Guatemala; Mexico
This tree species is found in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. The extent of occurrence (EOO) of 16,139 km2 falls within the Vulnerable threshold under Criteria B. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. It was determined that this species has six locations, which makes it Vulnerable.

Oxandra sphaerocarpa
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Brazil; Ecuador; Peru
This tree species occurs in periodically inundated forests of Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. While the extent of occurrence (EOO) of 755,224 km2 did not classify as threatened, the area of occupancy (AOO) of 48 km2 is small and could potentially qualify the species as threatened. Although the AOO is likely to be underestimate, it is not thought that the AOO exceeds 2,000 km2. From data on forest cover loss (Hansen et al. 2013), it was inferred that habitat loss is a threat for this species since it occurs in regions where forest cover loss has been observed in the past years. The number of locations was determined as 10, which means this species is assessed Vulnerable.

Piptostigma calophyllum
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Cameroon; Gabon
Piptostigma calophyllum is only distributed in the lowland forests of Gabon and Cameroon. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated at 114,382 km², far exceeding the threshold of the Vulnerable category under criterion B1. This small tree is both found in primary and secondary lowland rainforests, but it is not abundant where it occurs. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is small, being estimated to only 48 km², which qualifies for Endangered category under B2. More than half of the taxon's range is inferred to be affected by habitat degradation and habitat loss, mainly due to logging and forest clearance for agriculture. The species is thus considered to occur in seven to eight locations. In addition, the species is not known yet to occur in any protected areas. Therefore, Piptostigma calophyllum is listed as Vulnerable (B2ab(iii)).

Piptostigma goslineanum
Vulnerable B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)
Cameroon
Piptostigma goslineanum is an endemic understorey tree from the western part of Cameroon. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is small, at only 9,020 km² and its area of occupancy (AOO), is also restricted, at 40 km². More than half of the taxon’s range is affected by habitat loss due to forest clearance, for both subsistence farming and small-holder plantations and the species is considered to occur in six locations. Although the species is found in the Bayang Mbo Sanctuary and the Douala-Edea Faunal Reserve, the species is not reported to occur in National Parks. Therefore it is assessed as being Vulnerable (B1ab(iii)+B2ab(iii)).

Piptostigma macrophyllum
Vulnerable B2ab(iii,iv)
Cameroon
Piptostigma macrophyllum is an endemic small tree, growing up to 5–10 m tall, from the lowland rainforests of western Cameroon. Its extent of occurrence (EOO), estimated at 21,961 km², is just above the threshold for the Vulnerable Category under criterion B1. Within the EOO, its area of occupancy (AOO) is small, only 32 km², which qualifies for Endangered category under B2. The species is threatened by habitat loss due to forest clearance for both subsistence farming and industrial plantations and it is considered to occur in six locations. Thus, the condition "a" is met. In addition we infer a continuing decline in the extent of its habitat and number of subpopulations. Although the species is found in two National Parks (Korup and Mount Cameroon), it is assessed as being Vulnerable).

Piptostigma oyemense
Vulnerable B2ab(iii)
Cameroon; Gabon; Gabon
Piptostigma oyemense is an understorey small tree from western Central Africa (Cameroon, Gabon). Despite it has been recently collected both in Cameroon and Gabon, it is only represented by 10 herbarium specimens. This implies the species is fairly uncommon across its range. In addition, it is reported to be not abundant where it occurs and it is only found in primary lowland forests. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is not small, 106,446 km², exceeding the threshold of the Vulnerable category under criterion B1. However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is restricted, only 40 km², which qualifies for Endangered category under B2. The major threats to this species are habitat loss due to forest clearance for agriculture (especially in Cameroon) and habitat degradation/loss due to logging (In Gabon). The species is estimated to occur in eight threat-defined locations. The species is only known to occur in one protected area in Gabon (Monts de Cristal National Park). Therefore, the species is listed as Vulnerable (B2ab(iii)).

Polyalthia lasioclada
Vulnerable D2
Malaysia (Sabah)
Polyalthia lasioclada is restricted to the montane area in Kinabalu Park and Mensalong Forest Reserve, Sabah. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are 16 km2 and 29 km2, respectively. Due to land use change, estimated past loss of the species' AOO and EOO has been about 20% and 22%, respectively. Decline has now ceased as the species is protected in situ in at least two Totally Protected Areas. However, the species is at risk from potential threats such as climate change and forest fire which if they occur could drastically change its conservation status to Critically Endangered or Extinct. Hence, it is assessed as Vulnerable.
